## Executive Summary

**AWS Amplify** = Like hiring a fully managed apartment (everything is taken care of)
**EC2** = Like buying an empty house (you control everything but must maintain it)

### Quick Comparison
- **Amplify**: Easier, faster, more expensive at scale, less control
- **EC2**: Harder, slower setup, cheaper at scale, full control

## What is AWS Amplify?

### Analogy
AWS Amplify is like using a **managed hosting service** where AWS handles all the technical details for you. Think of it like staying at a full-service hotel:
- They clean your room (server maintenance)
- They provide breakfast (automatic deployments)
- They handle security (SSL certificates)
- They fix problems (auto-scaling, updates)

### What Amplify Does For You
1. **Automatic Deployments**
   - You push code to GitHub
   - Amplify automatically builds and deploys it
   - No manual steps needed

2. **Built-in Features**
   - SSL certificates (https://) - automatic and free
   - CDN (Content Delivery Network) - your site loads fast globally
   - Custom domains - easy setup
   - Preview deployments - test before going live

3. **Zero Server Management**
   - No Linux commands needed
   - No software to install or update
   - No security patches to apply
   - No server monitoring required

### How Amplify Works
```
Your Code (GitHub) ‚Üí Amplify detects changes ‚Üí Builds app ‚Üí Deploys globally ‚Üí Users access site
```

### Example Amplify Deployment
```bash
# That's it! You just:
1. Click "Connect to GitHub" in AWS Console
2. Select your repository
3. Click "Deploy"
# Your site is live in 5-10 minutes!
```

## What is EC2?

### Analogy
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is like **renting an empty computer** in AWS's data center. Think of it like renting an unfurnished apartment:
- You get the space (computing power)
- You must furnish it (install software)
- You pay utilities (bandwidth, storage)
- You handle maintenance (updates, security)

### What You Must Do With EC2
1. **Server Setup**
   - Install operating system (already done - Amazon Linux)
   - Install Node.js to run React
   - Install web server (Nginx/Apache)
   - Configure firewall rules
   - Set up SSL certificates manually

2. **Deployment Process**
   - Manually copy files to server
   - Build your React app
   - Configure web server
   - Set up process management
   - Handle updates manually

3. **Ongoing Maintenance**
   - Apply security updates
   - Monitor server health
   - Manage backups
   - Scale manually when needed
   - Fix issues when they occur

### How EC2 Works
```
Your Code ‚Üí Build locally ‚Üí Copy to EC2 ‚Üí Configure server ‚Üí Start services ‚Üí Users access site
         ‚Üë                                           ‚Üë
         You do all of this manually ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Example EC2 Deployment (Simplified)
```bash
# Connect to server
ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@your-server

# Install software (one time)
sudo yum install nodejs nginx git

# Copy your app
git clone your-repository
cd your-app
npm install
npm run build

# Configure web server
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf  # Edit configuration

# Start services
sudo systemctl start nginx
pm2 start app.js

# And much more...
```
